								<h3>Intro to JS</h3>
								<p>This module was where this semester took off for me. Instantly, the module grasped my attention with it's unique challanges and projects. This module contains so many great and diverse tasks that allow you to progress and learn as a student. The most significant aspect of the module, was the object-orientated design. This has given me the oppertunity to develope a skill set that can be used and implemented anywhere, and at anytime. From creating programs, to desiging art, object-orientation is the way to go!</p>

								<h3>Intro to HTML/CSS</h3>
								<p>If not for this module, you wouldn't be reading this. This entire webpage, believe it or not, was created using HTML and CSS. I will continue to develop my HTML, CSS, and JS skills forever, as this is where the future is headed. Even after the course is done, even after school is done, I will continue using this knowledge for my own use. The most significant aspect of this module was the CSS portion. The fact that you can turn anything from anything into anything, just blew my mind. All of the design, and everything you see, is CSS, and that is why it is my goal to fully understand the capabilities of CSS.</p>

								<h3>Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h3>
								<p>This is a very unique module. Something that people dont think about, is how do you make something look natural? Like it is supposed to be there, without looking like someone coded it? This will help me continue to learn as a student because it has so many creative challanges that you can change to your own desire. There are barely any limitations to what you can do with the vectors, the sound, the waves, and the particle systems. The most significat out of all was the vector section. With a vector you can do anything. Anything to do with movement, and animation, is most likely done by vectors or has vectors in it. This shows how important something can be, and how insignificant it may seem at first, but how cricial it is to learn.</p>

								<h3>Algorithms</h3>
								<p>There are many uses for algorithms. One of them is my favourite, art. Using algorithms and recursion, you can create beautiful designs that span tons of area, without having to place each ellipse, or each rectangle in the EXACT position that you want it in. Just let it flow. Another use, is sorting. Sometimes a bunch of data will be thrown at you, for you to sort. But that would take ages! Why not have an algorithm that can sort our data with one of many different sorting methods. There is so much to do, and so much to learn, and this will aid me later in university. Finaly, an aspect that might seem different... Cubing. Cubing requires algorithms. Cubing requires you to think, think ahead, memorize, comprehend, analyze, and much more. When I started ICS4U, I was able to solve the 2x2x2, and the 3x3x3. Now, I have a much greater list shown below.</p>

						<h2>Free Code Camp</h2>
						<div class="modules-container-camp">
							<div class="basic-html-and-html5">
								<h3>Basic HTML and HTML5</h3>
								<p>After completing HTML in Khan Academy, I had a very basic idea of what it does. However, after doing many more projects with the other modules, I forgot most of HTML and how to work with it. This was a great module, as it helped reinforce my understanding of the language. It gave me more things to practice on, and it helped grow and expand my knowledge on the topic. This just proves to me as a student that practice makes perfect, and if you want to get better, you need to keep repeating it.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="basic-css">
								<h3>Basic CSS</h3>
								<p>CSS is the most important language when it comes to webpages and designing them. Knowing how to efficiently utilise the language and to know all the variables, can reduce work times significantly. At first, when I didn't know much about CSS, it took me hours and hours just to get the simplest things take form on the webpage. I always had to look back at examples, and look back at definitions, in order to do anything. At this point, thanks to this module, I have understood most of the concepts and how to use them effectivly. Not memorized, but actually understood and able to have an efficient workflow.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="applied-visual-design">
								<h3>Applied Visual Design</h3>
								<p>Even after making a webpage, it is not very usefull if noboy wants to look at it. Visual Design teaches how to adjust items and containers relative to other objects on the page. It shows how you can transform and move around every single thing on the webpage. Noto only does it show how to do a nice layout of a webpage, it also teaches about complementary and tertiery colors. This has taught me so much, and helped make my webpage veiwable. Now I can proudly say, that people's eyes won't bleed after looking at my webpage for more than a minute!</p>
							</div>
							<div class="responsive-web-design">
								<h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
								<p>This module is a very nitty-gritty thing to do. However, it is probably one of the most important! If people are looking at your webpage with different screen dimensions, you want it to fit properly. Whether they are on their phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop, shouldn't matter. Your webpage should fit and fix itself accordingly. As a student, I learned that many things happen behind the scenes. Before, when I went onto a website from a phone and desktop, I didn't even take a second to realise how different it was, and how much work was really there. I learned how to use the user's viewport in order to adjust the webpage to zoom, or size of display.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="css-flexbox">
								<h3>CSS Flexbox</h3>
								<p>Probably the most important part of making a webpage look organized. Moving around items, having containers inside containers, and floating them all over your page. The funny thing is, change 1 variable, and EVERYTHING collapses. One of the most painful proccesses I have encountered. However, this entire webpage uses the flexbox as it's main component. The buttons, the headers, even my profile name, all contain flex.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="css-grid">
								<h3>CSS Grid</h3>
								<p>The CSS grid is another way to organize items inside a container. My rubik's cubes are positioned in a grid layout. It is much simpler to use than flexbox, but not as free-flowing and smooth. It's a grid... "Modern" style websites with sleek sharp edges could benefit from the CSS grid. but more cartoonish and smoother web pages are much better without it. You can see a clear difference when it comes to CSS grid versus flexbox. The buttons use flexbox, the cubes use grid. Very different styles. It is more about how to use it, and when to know where to use it. Sometimes there is just a right time and a right place.</p>
