								<h3>Intro to JS</h3>
								<p>This module was where this semester took off for me. Instantly, the module grasped my attention with it's unique challanges and projects. This module contains so many great and diverse tasks that allow you to progress and learn as a student. The most significant aspect of the module, was the object-orientated design. This has given me the oppertunity to develope a skill set that can be used and implemented anywhere, and at anytime. From creating programs, to desiging art, object-orientation is the way to go!</p>

								<h3>Intro to HTML/CSS</h3>
								<p>If not for this module, you wouldn't be reading this. This entire webpage, believe it or not, was created using HTML and CSS. I will continue to develop my HTML, CSS, and JS skills forever, as this is where the future is headed. Even after the course is done, even after school is done, I will continue using this knowledge for my own use. The most significant aspect of this module was the CSS portion. The fact that you can turn anything from anything into anything, just blew my mind. All of the design, and everything you see, is CSS, and that is why it is my goal to fully understand the capabilities of CSS.</p>

								<h3>Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h3>
								<p>This is a very unique module. Something that people dont think about, is how do you make something look natural? Like it is supposed to be there, without looking like someone coded it? This will help me continue to learn as a student because it has so many creative challanges that you can change to your own desire. There are barely any limitations to what you can do with the vectors, the sound, the waves, and the particle systems. The most significat out of all was the vector section. With a vector you can do anything. Anything to do with movement, and animation, is most likely done by vectors or has vectors in it. This shows how important something can be, and how insignificant it may seem at first, but how cricial it is to learn.</p>

								<h3>Algorithms</h3>
								<p>There are many uses for algorithms. One of them is my favourite, art. Using algorithms and recursion, you can create beautiful designs that span tons of area, without having to place each ellipse, or each rectangle in the EXACT position that you want it in. Just let it flow. Another use, is sorting. Sometimes a bunch of data will be thrown at you, for you to sort. But that would take ages! Why not have an algorithm that can sort our data with one of many different sorting methods. There is so much to do, and so much to learn, and this will aid me later in university. Finaly, an aspect that might seem different... Cubing. Cubing requires algorithms. Cubing requires you to think, think ahead, memorize, comprehend, analyze, and much more. When I started ICS4U, I was able to solve the 2x2x2, and the 3x3x3. Now, I have a much reater list shown below.</p>
